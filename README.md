# Love Letters Reimplementation Remix (2024)
This 2024 version of Love Letters remixes Nick Montfort’s 2014 reimplementation of Christopher Strachey’s 1953 Love Letters. Put simply, it creates a series of love letters in a web browser by choosing, at random, phrases we collected from two sources: candy hearts (a Valentine’s classic, albeit chalky, candy) and song titles played on air during Dallas-based KXT’s Anti-Love Song Valentine’s Playlist (2024). We made this as a hack-a-thon project during International Love Data Week. 

Strachey’s Love Letters is known as the first work of electronic literature, an algorithm for generating love letters for the 1952 Manchester Mark 1 computer. Montfort shares the code for this project, newly implemented for the web browser. LabSynthE updates the language of the love letters and makes things a little bit complicated. Are we staying together or breaking up? Chance will tell.

Charm your valentine with a candy-infused love, or maybe anti-love, letter. LabSynthE is a laboratory for synthetic and electronic poetry in UT Dallas’ Bass School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology led by xtine burrough.
