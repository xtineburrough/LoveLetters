# Love Letters Reimplementation Remix (2024)
This remix changes the language in Nick Montfort’s 2014 reimplementation of Christopher Strachey’s 1953 Love Letters. Known as the first work of electronic literature, Love Letters was an algorithm that generated love letters for the 1952 Manchester Mark 1 computer. In 2014 Montfort reimplemented the code for this project such that it would run in a web browser. LabSynthE updates the language of Montfort’s (via Strachey’s) love letters, complicating the textual relationship. Our love letters are a mashup of phrases collected from two sources: 2024 candy hearts (for example, “BAE,” “GOAT,” “REALZ”) and song titles played on air during Dallas-based KXT’s Anti-Love Song Valentine’s Playlist & 2024 Pledge Drive. We may be writing love letters or break-up notes, only the algorithm knows.

LabSynthE is a laboratory for synthetic and electronic poetry in UT Dallas’ Bass School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology led by xtine burrough.
