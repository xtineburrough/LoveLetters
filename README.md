# LoveLetters
This project remixes Nick Montfort’s 2014 reimplementation of Christopher Strachey’s 1953 Love Letters. Put simply, it creates a series of love letters in a web browser by choosing, at random, phrases we collected from two sources: candy hearts (a Valentine’s classic, albeit chalky, candy) and song titles played on air during KXT’s Anti-Love Song Valentine’s Day Set (2024). We made this as a hack-a-thon project during International Love Data Week. Charm your valentine with a candy-infused love or maybe anti-love letter. LabSynthE is a laboratory for synthetic and electronic poetry in UT Dallas’ Bass School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology led by xtine burrough.
