# Love Letters Reimplementation Remix (2024)
This remix changes the language in Nick Montfort’s 2014 reimplementation of Christopher Strachey’s 1953 Love Letters. Known as the first work of electronic literature, Strachey created an algorithm that generated love letters for the 1952 Manchester Mark 1 computer. In 2014 Montfort reimplemented the code for this project such that it would run in a web browser.

As a hack-a-thon project during International Love Data Week, LabSynthE updated the language of Montfort’s (via Strachey’s) Love Letters Reimplementation, complicating the textual relationship. Our love letters are a mashup of phrases collected from two sources: 2024 candy hearts (for example, “BAE,” “GOAT,” “REALZ”) and song titles played on air during Dallas-based KXT’s Anti-Love Song Valentine’s Playlist & 2024 Pledge Drive (ie. "Cold Little Heart," "Love is a Burden," "Sick of Myself"). 

We may be writing love letters or break-up notes, only the algorithm knows. Viewers can copy and paste to charm their valentine with a candy-infused letter complete with love and anti-love sentiments. 

LabSynthE is a laboratory for synthetic and electronic poetry in UT Dallas’ Bass School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology led by xtine burrough.

This is a work of art was originally made to be viewed in the web browser (February 2024). In April 2024, we exhibited the project as a large-format video in AURORA's Video Art Nights in Pegasus Plaza, Downtown Dallas.
