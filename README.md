# Love Letters Reimplementation Remix (2024)
This browser remix changes the language in Nick Montfort’s 2014 reimplementation of Christopher Strachey’s 1953 Love Letters. Phrases we collected from two sources are put into a series of short love letters for the web browser: candy hearts (a Valentine’s classic, albeit chalky, candy) and song titles played on air during Dallas-based KXT’s Anti-Love Song Valentine’s Playlist & Pledge Drive (2024). We made this in a hack-a-thon during International Love Data Week. 

Strachey’s Love Letters is known as the first work of electronic literature, an algorithm for generating love letters for the 1952 Manchester Mark 1 computer. In 2014 Montfort shared the code for this project, newly implemented for the web browser. LabSynthE updates the language of the love letters to make things a little  complicated: Are we staying together or breaking up? Chance will tell.

Charm your valentine with a candy-infused love, or maybe anti-love, letter. 

LabSynthE is a laboratory for synthetic and electronic poetry in UT Dallas’ Bass School of Arts, Humanities, and Technology led by xtine burrough.
